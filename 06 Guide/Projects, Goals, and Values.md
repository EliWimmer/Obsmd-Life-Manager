The folders [[01 Tasks]], [[02 Projects]], [[03 Goals]], and [[04 Values]] all contain a dashboard for their contents as a folder note. They show a card view (minimal theme required for cards) of all contents, and are a great place to link and write notes and info about the overall concepts of each.
