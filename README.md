# Obsidian Life Manager
OLM is a productivity system for Obsidian. Includes task and project management, goal setting, habit tracking, and periodic reviews. Loosely based on [August Bradley's PPV System](http://www.augustbradley.com/).

## Install
1. Clone or download and unzip this repo. Set up as new vault.
2. Click this link in Obsidian: [[Quick Start]]

*A guide on integrating this system into your current vault will unfortunately not be made, as it would be heavily dependant on your setup. If you would like to integrate another vault, I suggest gradually copying over into this one so as not to accidentily reset plugin settings required for this system.*
